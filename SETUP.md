# Project Setup ‚Äî AWS Serverless Image Recognition

This guide provides setup instructions for deploying the serverless image recognition pipeline using AWS services.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- AWS Account (Free Tier is sufficient for testing)
- Basic familiarity with the AWS Management Console

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è AWS Services Used
- **S3:** Object storage for images and detection result reports.
- **Lambda:** Event-driven function for processing images.
- **Rekognition:** AI-powered image analysis.
- **IAM:** Role-based access permissions.
- *(Optional)* Additional integrations via DynamoDB, API Gateway, SNS.

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Create S3 Bucket
- Navigate to **S3** ‚Üí **Create Bucket**.
- Name the bucket (e.g., `image-upload-pipeline`).
- Default settings are sufficient for testing.

---

### 2. Create IAM Role
- Go to **IAM** ‚Üí **Roles** ‚Üí **Create Role**.
- Choose **Lambda** as the trusted entity.
- Attach these policies:
  - `AmazonRekognitionFullAccess`
  - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
- Name the role: `rekognition-lambda-role`.

---

### 3. Create Lambda Function
- Navigate to **Lambda** ‚Üí **Create Function** ‚Üí Author from scratch.
- Function name: `image-analyzer`.
- Runtime: **Python 3.12**.
- Assign the previously created IAM role (`rekognition-lambda-role`).

---

### 4. Deploy Lambda Code
- Paste the provided code from `lambda_function.py` into the Lambda console.
- Deploy the function.

---

### 5. Configure S3 Trigger
- In your S3 bucket:
  - Go to **Properties** ‚Üí **Event Notifications** ‚Üí **Create event notification**.
  - Select **All object create events** as the trigger.
  - Set your Lambda function as the destination.

---

### 6. Test the Pipeline
- Upload an image to the S3 bucket.
- Monitor Lambda execution logs in **CloudWatch**.
- Detection results will be:
  - Displayed in CloudWatch Logs.
  - Auto-saved as `.txt` reports in S3 alongside the image.

---

## üìù Notes
- The pipeline automatically processes uploaded images and stores detection results with no manual intervention.
- Fully serverless and event-driven.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Resource Cleanup
After testing, delete all unused AWS resources (S3 bucket, Lambda function, IAM role) to prevent ongoing charges.
